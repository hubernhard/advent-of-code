# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## Setup

Make sure [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is installed
on your system, clone the repository and run:

```shell
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

## Initialize a new day using the template

```shell
poetry run python -m aoc <YEAR> <DAY>
```
